Army Betrayal Prediction Using XGBoost
This project aims to predict the likelihood of betrayal among soldiers in an army unit based on various factors such as greed, respect for commanders, financial debt, loyalty record, temptation by enemies, and other engineered features. The prediction model uses XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm that is particularly effective for classification problems.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to identify soldiers who are at risk of betraying their army. The dataset contains a variety of features related to personal, professional, and environmental factors affecting the soldiers. These factors are fed into an XGBoost model to predict the risk of betrayal, a binary classification task.

Features
The following features are used in the model:

Greed: Quantified on a scale from 1 to 10.
Respect for Commanders: Scaled from 1 to 10 based on soldier respect levels.
Financial Debt: Integer value representing debt level on a scale from 1 to 10.
Past Loyalty Record: Binary feature (1 for loyal, 0 for past rebellious behavior).
Temptation by Enemy: Integer feature capturing the level of temptation based on enemy influence (1-10).
Number of Missions: Integer feature representing the number of missions completed.
Family Hardship: Binary feature indicating if the soldier has been affected by recent family struggles (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Military Performance: Scaled from 1 to 10 based on recent performance.
Mission Risk: Integer value representing the risk level of the soldierâ€™s missions.

Feature Engineering
Several engineered features are created to better capture the relationships between variables:
